            A natural disaster is a devastating event caused by rain, wind, fire, and even earth that endangers people's lives and property. Natural disasters claim thousands of lives every year. One of the most important aspects of managing
            a natural disaster is to identify the people affected by it. Our app will create a centralised database that will enable the relatives as well as relief teams dispatched by the government to conduct a crowd sourced, real time
            census of people affected by a natural disaster. <br> <br>
            geoScope finds match between a picture that you upload and the a picture present in the database
            to aid the relief workers during a natural disaster.
